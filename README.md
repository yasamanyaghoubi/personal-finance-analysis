data cleaning ,EDA and analysis of personal daily costs dataset (self-collected)


ðŸ“Š Personal Daily Costs Analysis


ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes self-collected personal finance data from my daily spending notebook.
I transformed raw handwritten records into a structured dataset, cleaned it, and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand spending habits, savings rates, and opportunities to optimize costs.

The project demonstrates:

Real-world data collection (messy â†’ structured)

Data cleaning & preprocessing in Python (dates, categories, reimbursements, etc.)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with pandas

Extracting financial insights & KPIs from raw transactions

ðŸ—‚ Dataset

Source: My own spending records (not synthetic data)

Raw fields: date, month, day_of_week, amount, description

Cleaned fields: datetime, day_of_week, category, sub_category, amount, description

Period covered: 2025-03-28 â†’ 2025-08-24

Size: 315 transactions

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning

Main steps:

Date normalization: combined day/month into datetime column (year = 2025).

Amount normalization: all amounts positive; added type = expense/income.

Category/Subcategory mapping: built rulebook for groceries, cafes, utilities, gifts, etc.

Reimbursements handling: recorded as income â†’ Reimbursements so net category spend is accurate.

Export: final cleaned dataset â†’ data/processed/daily_costs_cleaned.csv.
